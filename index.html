    <h2>BIT ABOUT ME</h2>
    <span>I believe that you can know me enough just by knowing how much i love books but i'll give you more info</span> <br>
    <span>i'll just say what really matters for the blog, ok?</span> <br>
    <p>My name is Valeria, i've read some books but if i love a phrase is this one "how many is a lot of books?". I enjoy reading bout romance, comedy, rom-coms! OMG! just loveeee them, fantasy is just my everyday and sometimes i can get serious and read bout history.i'm young so of course im gonna leave a space for you to name your favorite books so i can read new stuff too</p>
    <p>the first book i read was narnia, and i love it but if im honest with you guys, i never read the whole saga, just the first book i dunno why but i was never interested in flollowing the whole story i just saw the movies.</p>
    <p>i love reading with music, i can add tension, a romantic environment, and a lot of feelings with just music or different sounds even nature ones.</p>
    <p>take notes because the most important thing you have to know is this...</p>
